 you’re not the only one. Becoming bored with video games can happen to every gamer  even when there seems to be no good reason. I’ve been there myself, so I did some research on why video games become boring.

are predictable and offer no surprises to the player, don't present enough of a <br> challenge for players, 
have poor pacing that requires too much work for too little <br> reward, or simply aren't fun from the beginning
